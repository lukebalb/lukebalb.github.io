                <p class="text-md">“I’ve been involved with SEO for twelve years and Gary is the best expert I’ve ever worked with. Algorithms are changing rapidly and drastically and it’s important to stay on top of the latest developments. I’ve never come across a change that Gary wasn’t already aware of. He keeps a cool head when we see fluctuations in performance, is patient to let things settle out and makes adjustments when the data tells him it is time. SEO is a long term play and we sometimes have clients get impatient, but when Gary gets to respond to the clients directly, they consistently come away with confidence that we’re on the right track and we know what we’re doing. Gary is incredibly easy to work with, a reliable teammate and an excellent communicator.”</p>
